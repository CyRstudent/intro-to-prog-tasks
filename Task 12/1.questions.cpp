/**
 * a) 
 * i) A structure can contain multiple types, while arrays only can store a type of data
 * ii) You need to use the <array> library to use arrays, but don't need a library for structures
 * b) You could tell the imaginary from the real apart declaring them with names in
 * c) That is, we can define various types of data inside a single structure, whilst in an array, you can only use a single type of data
 * d) I think it is a substitution for spaces, which are used to do searches on search engines. Nonetheless, the dots on the internet dot notation has nothing to do with the dots used in structures; the equivalent of that would be the forward-slash (/)
 * e) Because the law of trichotomy is only defined for the set of real numbers, meaning you can't compare a structure with 2 or more data types because that'd imply definining if (1, 2) > (2, 1) etc... which is mathematically illogical
