/**
 * a) Legal
 * b) Legal
 * c) Legal
 * d) Illegal. A void function does not return a value, so you're declaring a variable without giving it an actual value
 * e) Legal
 * f) Legal
 * g) Kind of illegal. While the "if" statement is meant to be used with boolean values, an integer value that is not 0 will be assumed to be "true"
 * h) Illegal. Use of void function as an argument which requires an integer to be passed as the main parameter. Again, void does not return any value whatsoever.
 * i) Illegal. It is passing an integer and not a variable in the first parameter
